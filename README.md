# NS-3 Simulator for RDMA Network Load Balancing

This is a Github repository for the SIGCOMM'23 paper "[Network Load Balancing with In-network Reordering Support for RDMA](https://doi.org/10.1145/3603269.3604849)".

We describe how to run this repository either on docker or using your local machine with `ubuntu:20.04`. 


## Run with Docker

#### Docker Engine
For Ubuntu, following the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and make sure to apply the necessary post-install [steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
Eventually, you should be able to launch the `hello-world` Docker container without the `sudo` command: `docker run hello-world`.

#### 0. Prerequisites
First, you do all these:

```shell
wget https://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-allinone-3.19.tar.bz2
tar -xvf ns-allinone-3.19.tar.bz2
cd ns-allinone-3.19
rm -rf ns-3.19
git clone https://github.com/conweave-project/conweave-ns3.git ns-3.19
```

#### 1. Create a Dockerfile
Here, `ns-allinone-3.19` will be your root directory.

Create a Dockerfile at the root directory with the following:
```shell
FROM ubuntu:20.04
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt update && apt install -y gnuplot python python3 python3-pip build-essential libgtk-3-0 bzip2 wget git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && pip3 install numpy matplotlib cycler
WORKDIR /root
```

Then, you do this: 
```shell
docker build -t cw-sim:sigcomm23ae .
```

Once the container is built, do this from the root directory:
```shell
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/root cw-sim:sigcomm23ae bash -c "cd ns-3.19; ./waf configure --build-profile=optimized; ./waf"
```

This should build everything necessary for the simulator.

#### 2. Run
One can always just run the container: 
```shell
docker run -it --name cw-sim -v $(pwd):/root cw-sim:sigcomm23ae 
cd ns-3.19;
./autorun.sh
```

That will run `0.1 second` simulation of 8 experiments which are a part of Figure 12 and 13 in the paper.
In the script, you can easily change the network load (e.g., `50%`), runtime (e.g., `0.1s`), or topology (e.g., `leaf-spine`).
To plot the FCT graph, see below or refer to the script `./analysis/plot_fct.py`.
To plot the Queue Usage graph, see below or refer to the script `./analysis/plot_queue.py`.

:exclamation: **To run processes in background**, use the commands:
```shell
docker run -dit --name cw-sim -v $(pwd):/root cw-sim:sigcomm23ae 
docker exec -it cw-sim /bin/bash

root@252578ceff68:~# cd ns-3.19/
root@252578ceff68:~/ns-3.19# ./autorun.sh

Run IRN RDMA experiments...
Runing all in parallel. Check the processors running on background!
root@252578ceff68:~/ns-3.19# exit
exit
```

#### 3. Plot
You can easily plot the results using the following command:
```shell
python3 ./analysis/plot_fct.py
python3 ./analysis/plot_queue.py
python3 ./analysis/plot_uplink.py
```

See below for details of output results.

## Run NS-3 on Ubuntu 20.04
#### 0. Prerequisites
We tested the simulator on Ubuntu 20.04, but latest versions of Ubuntu should also work.
```shell
sudo apt install build-essential python3 libgtk-3-0 bzip2
```
For plotting, we use `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `cycler` for python3:
```shell
python3 -m pip install numpy matplotlib cycler
```


#### 1. Configure & Build
```shell
wget https://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-allinone-3.19.tar.bz2
tar -xvf ns-allinone-3.19.tar.bz2
cd ns-allinone-3.19
rm -rf ns-3.19
git clone https://github.com/conweave-project/conweave-ns3.git ns-3.19
cd ns-3.19
./waf configure --build-profile=optimized
./waf
```


#### 2. Simulation
##### Run
You can reproduce the simulation results of Figure 12 and 13 (FCT slowdown), Figure 16 (Queue usage per switch) by running the script:
```shell
./autorun.sh
```

In the script, you can easily change the network load (e.g., `50%`), runtime (e.g., `0.1s`), or topology (e.g., `leaf-spine`).
This takes a few hours, and requires 8 CPU cores and 10G RAM.
Note that we do not run `DRILL` since it takes too much time due to many out-of-order packets.


If you want to run the simulation individually, try this command:
```shell
python3 ./run.py --h
```

It first calls a traffic generator `./traffic_gen/traffic_gen.py` to create an input trace.
Then, it runs NS-3 simulation script `./scratch/network-load-balance.cc`. 
Lastly, it runs FCT analyzer `./fctAnalysis.py` and switch resource analyzer `./queueAnalysis.py`. 


##### Plot
You can easily plot the results using the following command:
```shell
python3 ./analysis/plot_fct.py
python3 ./analysis/plot_queue.py
python3 ./analysis/plot_uplink.py
```

The outcome figures are located at `./analysis/figures`. 
1. The script requires input parameters such as `-sT` and `-fT` which indicate the time window to analyze the fct result. 
By default, it assuems to use `0.1 second` runtime. 
2. `plot_fct.py` plots the Average and 99-percentile FCT result and give comparisons between frameworks. It excludes `5ms` of warm-up and `50ms` of cool-down period in measurements. You can control these numbers in `run.py`:
```python
fct_analysis_time_limit_begin = int(flowgen_start_time * 1e9) + int(0.005 * 1e9)  # warmup
fct_analysistime_limit_end = int(flowgen_stop_time * 1e9) + int(0.05 * 1e9)  # extra term
```
or, directly put parameters into `plot_fct.py`. Use `-h` for details. 
3. `plot_queue.py` plots the CDF of queue volume usage per switch for ConWeave. It excludes `5ms` of warm-up period, and cool-down period is not used as it would _underestimate_ the overhead. Similarly, you can control this number in `run.py`:
```python
queue_analysis_time_limit_begin = int(flowgen_start_time * 1e9) + int(0.005 * 1e9)  # warmup
queue_analysistime_limit_end = int(flowgen_stop_time * 1e9) # no extra term!!
```
or, directly put parameters into `plot_queue.py`. Use `-h` for details. 
4. `plot_uplink.py` plots the load balance efficiency with ToR uplink utility. By default, it captures uplink throughputs for every `100Âµs` and measure the variations. It excludes `5ms` of warm-up and `50ms` of cool-down period in measurements. 
Or, directly put parameters into `plot_uplink.py`. Use `-h` for details. 

##### Output
As well as above figures, other results are located at `./mix/output`, such as uplink usage (Figure 14), queue number usage per port (Figure 15), etc.

* At `./mix/output`, several raw data is stored such as 
  * Flow Completion Time (`XXX_out_fct.txt`), - Figure 12, 13
  * PFC generation (`XXX_out_pfc.txt`), 
  * Uplink's utility (`XXX_out_uplink.txt`), - Figure 14
  * Number of connections (`XXX_out_conn.txt`), 
  * Congestion Notification Packet (`XXX_out_cnp.txt`).
  * CDF of number of queues usage per egress port (`XXX_out_voq_per_dst_cdf.txt`). - Figure 15 
  * CDF of total queue memory overhead per switch (`XXX_out_voq_cdf.txt`). - Figure 16
  
* Each run of simulation creates a repository in `./mix/output` with simulation ID (10-digit number).
* Inside the folder, you can check the simulation config `config.txt` and output log `config.log`. 
* The output files include post-processed files such as CDF results.
* The history of simulations will be recorded in `./mix/.history`. 

##### Topology
To evaluate on fat-tree (K=8) topology, you can simply change the `TOPOLOGY` variable in `autorun.sh` to `fat_k8_100G_OS2`:
```shell
TOPOLOGY="leaf_spine_128_100G_OS2" # or, fat_k8_100G_OS2
```

##### Clean up
To clean all data of previous simulation results, you can run the command:
```shell
./cleanup.sh
```

#### ConWeave Parameters
We include ConWeave's parameter values into `./run.py` based on flow control model and topology.  


### Simulator Structure
Most implementations of network load balancing are located in the directory `./src/point-to-point/model`.

* `switch-node.h/cc`: Switching logic that includes a default multi-path routing protocol (e.g., ECMP) and DRILL.
* `switch-mmu.h/cc`: Ingress/egress admission control and PFC.
* `conga-routing.h/cc`: Conga routing protocol.
* `letflow-routing.h/cc`: Letflow routing protocol.
* `conweave-routing.h/cc`: ConWeave routing protocol.
* `conweave-voq.h/cc`: ConWeave in-network reordering buffer.
* `settings.h/cc`: Global variables for logging and debugging.
* `rdma-hw.h/cc`: RDMA-enable NIC behavior model.

<b> RNIC behavior model to out-of-order packet arrival </b>
As disussed in the paper, we observe that RNIC reacts to even a single out-of-order packet sensitively by sending CNP packet.
However, existing RDMA-NS3 simulator (HPCC, DCQCN, TLT-RDMA, etc) did not account for this.
In this simulator, we implemented that behavior in `rdma-hw.cc`.
